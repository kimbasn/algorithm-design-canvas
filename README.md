# Algorithm Design Canvas

<div align="center">

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A modern, open-source platform that transforms algorithm design from a mental process into a structured, visual workspace. Built on the principles from [hiredintech's Algorithm Design Canvas](https://www.hiredintech.com/algorithms/algorithm-design-canvas/what-is-the-canvas/), this tool helps developers, students, and interviewees better plan, document, and share their algorithmic solutions.
